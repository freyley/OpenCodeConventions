# OpenCodeConventions

This is intended to be a collection of code conventions that are about good programming practice, and not about style and formatting. Good programming practice differs from language to language, and there is also some disagreement from programmer to programmer. Ideally most of this project will be universal, but will support customization of your particular code convention.
